# Active Learning
Implements the Active Finite Reward Automaton Inference and Reinforcement Learning (AFRAI-RL) algorithm and Case Study Algorithms

The following algorithms are present:<br>
-Active Finite Reward Automaton Inference and Reinforcement Learning (AFRAI-RL) in active16 folder<br>
-Joint Inference of Reward Machines and Policies (JIRP) in JIRP_code folder<br>
-Learned Reward Machines (qrm implementation) in JIRP_LRM folder

# Prerequisites:
Ubuntu or Linux Operating System: Code runs bash commands that are not native to Windows OS (ie. ls not a valid windows command line operation)

## Tensorflow Version 2
The code may issue warnings about Tensorflow version 2. Please ignore these, as they will be addressed in a later update of the code.<br>
Tensorflow Version 1 will cause errors.

# How to run examples
## AFRAI-RL
In a command line, navigate to *JIRP_LRM/active16/src*. Use this command
``` python3 run1.py -W ignore```

## JIRP-SAT
In a command line, navigate to *JIRP_LRM/JIRP_code/src*. Use this command
``` python3 run1.py -W ignore```
## LRM-QRM
In a command line, navigate to *JIRP_LRM/JIRP_LRM/src*. Use this command
``` python3 run1.py -W ignore```
